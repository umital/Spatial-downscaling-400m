# Spatial-downscaling-400m

This repository is a copy of data and the python script (`Downscaling_workflow.ipynb`) that accompany the following peer-reviewed publication:

Mital, U., Dwivedi, D., Brown, J. B., and Steefel, C. I.: Downscaled hyper-resolution (400 m) gridded datasets of daily precipitation and temperature (2008–2019) for the East–Taylor subbasin (western United States), Earth Syst. Sci. Data, 14, 4949–4966, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-4949-2022, 2022.

## Project Summary
I developed a new machine learning algorithm to reduce the spatial resolution of (or spatially downscale) meteorological datasets. Using this dataset, I modeled snowpack in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, which improved the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) in 6 out of 8 instances (when compared to using the coarse resolution dataset). <br>
